# Zoomable Art Gallery

This repository hosts a collection of Deep Zoom image viewers built with [OpenSeadragon](https://openseadragon.github.io/).

Each subfolder corresponds to a high-resolution artwork and includes:

- A `.dzi` file describing the Deep Zoom structure
- A `_files/` directory with image tiles
- An `index.html` page to view and zoom the image in-browser

## How to view

Example viewer pages:
- `/bird/`
- `/blue_bird/`
- `/vase/`

All images are zoomable and pannable using OpenSeadragon.
